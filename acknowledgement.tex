\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
% Don't change anything above this.
% We do not number this or add it to the contents!
% Overly long acknowledgements are not professsional.

Thanks Ma, Thanks Pa. One paragraph in normal language is the most respectful. Different universities may place this near the front, near the end, etc. This is where ours go, at the end. It is optional. It should not be more than half a page. 

Acknowledgements are out of place in a science paper such as in a journal (but may be more suited to longer projects like MSc or PhD).
The AIMS essay is short, but is in preparation for an MSc, and exceptional, so you may have an acknowledgement and/or dedication. DO not change the heading. It should be less than half a page long, normal font size, not in the table of contents, no centralised text, no ALL CAPS, no bold, and no extra dedications, and don't move it after the references. Do not
use too much bold, any figures, or sign at the bottom. If you have this, then it should only be a paragraph or two.
