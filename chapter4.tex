\chapter{The Second Squared Chapter}

The average essay will be five chapters, but I didn't plan my work properly
and then ran out of time. I spent too much time positioning my figures and worrying
about my preferred typographic style, rather than just using what was provided.
I wasted days bolding section headings and using double slash line endings, and 
had to remove them all again. It took a long time to fix manually numbered lists
to use the \LaTeX\ environments because I didn't use them from the start or understand
how to search and replace easily with texmaker.

Everyone has to take some shortcuts
at some point to meet deadlines. Time did not allow to test model 
B as well. So I'll skip right ahead and put that under my Future Work section.
Conclusion. Future possibilities. Meaning. Usefulness.

Some students may have 3, 5 or 6 chapters. This is just an example. More importantly, do you have $\pm$25 pages? Plan and condense. To submit 25 pages you might write much more and then fix the best ones and cut the ideas. Mostly this essay is about clearly presenting the work. Luck has nothing to do with it. It's pure talent and newly acquired skills. Perhaps some persistence. What was that about perspiration? Some team work helps, so every now and then read one another's essays.
